                    <p>Virmansha was moved by the idea of "upcycling textile waste." The motto was crystal clear from day one,
                        "To Create upcycled, Eco-friendly Sustainable Daily utility products".</p>
                    <p>We train and upskill the local women artisans in Upcycling and provide training and employment to them.
                        Incorporating traditional crafts with the art of Upcycling is what the amazing artisans do at Virmansha.</p>
